### Compiling the front-end JavaScript ###
The source for the front-end JavaScript is located under `/public/resources/js/src`. However, to preserve ES5 compatibility, Babel is used to compile the source. If you make changes to the front-end code, make sure to run `npm run build` to compile the code.
